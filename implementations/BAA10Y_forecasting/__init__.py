"""BAA10Y multivariate spread-change forecasting with leak-safe covariates.

The demo notebooks are narrative shells over the modules in this directory:

- :mod:`data` — BAA10Y target construction, multivariate data service, and
  canonical covariate IDs.
- :mod:`predictors` — ``build_baa10y_llmp_sampled_trajectory()`` recipe (prompt framing + sampling budget).
- :mod:`leaderboard` — ``build_leaderboard()`` turns cached results into ``RESULTS_DF``.
- :mod:`analysis` — styled leaderboards and direction metrics.
- :mod:`plots` — matplotlib figures (target history, per-horizon CRPS, forecast vs realised return).
- YAML specs — experiment design only (window + one single-horizon task xxx need update later 

See ``README.md`` for the full experiment description.
