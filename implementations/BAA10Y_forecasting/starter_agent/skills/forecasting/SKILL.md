# Forecasting skill

Load this when your task payload asks for a structured forecast. For open-ended
questions, ignore it and just answer.

## What you'll receive

A JSON payload describing the task: a `task` id, the `as_of` cutoff date,
`horizons` (steps ahead), the `standard_quantiles` grid, a `target_summary`, the
recent `target_history_csv`, and an `output_schema` showing the exact JSON to
return.

## The output contract

1. Produce **one forecast per horizon** in `horizons`.
2. Use **exactly** the levels in `standard_quantiles` — no additions or omissions.
3. `point_forecast` must equal the **0.50 quantile** value.
4. Quantile values must be **non-decreasing** as the quantile level rises.
5. Use ONLY information available on or before `as_of`.
6. Put your reasoning in the `rationale` fields.

Submit by calling `set_model_response` with a `json_response` string that
matches the payload's `output_schema` **exactly** — use `"horizon"` (an
integer), and make `"quantiles"` a **list** of `{"quantile": <level>, "value":
<number>}` objects. Omit any field not shown in the schema.

## Calibration

Report calibrated intervals, not false precision: across many forecasts where
your 80% band is stated, the truth should land inside it about 80% of the time.
Anchor the point on the recent level and trend; let recent **volatility** set
how wide the bands are, and widen them as the horizon grows.

## Domain focus (edit this for your use case)

For BAA10Y spread changes, keep the point forecast near zero unless the target
history or covariates provide a meaningful directional signal. Recent
volatility is generally more informative for determining the width of the
forecast distribution than for predicting direction. 
Positive values represent spread widening and negative values represent spread
tightening. During stressed periods, widening moves may create a larger positive
tail than the magnitude of routine tightening. Allow this asymmetry only when
supported by recent history or available market covariates.
The target series already represents the cumulative BAA10Y spread change for
its configured horizon. Forecast it directly rather than aggregating it again.
Mention any important market or macro signal used in the rationale.

## Room to grow

- Tighten the calibration guidance with your own backtest findings.
- Add worked examples of good vs. over-confident forecasts.
