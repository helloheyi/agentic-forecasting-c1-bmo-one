"""BAA1OY recipe: sampled-trajectory LLMP (target-only and with-covariates).

This file is intentionally small and explicit so notebook readers can open it as
a reference recipe. The reusable method lives in ``aieng.forecasting``; this
module captures the BAA1OY prompt framing (what the series *is* and how returns
behave), the default sampling budget, the history window, and the cache tag used
by the experiment.

Two variants share this builder:

- **target-only** — ``covariate_series_ids=None``; the LLM sees only the return
  history.
- **with-covariates** — pass the covariate panel; the predictor serializes
  labeled covariate-history blocks (VIX, yields, …) into the prompt, so its CRPS
  gap vs the target-only variant answers "can an LLM use the same exogenous
  observations the ML methods do?".

    """Build the BAA10Y sampled-trajectory LLMP predictor.

    The model is a normal parameter because the base LLMP ``predictor_id``
    already includes it. The recipe tag records the BAA10Y prompt/config family,
    whether the covariate panel is in context, and the cache-relevant knobs that
    are not otherwise visible in the ID.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : str
        Model identifier. Defaults to the lite model (``gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview``).
    n_samples : int
        Number of trajectory samples to draw per prediction call.
    history_window : int or None
        Number of most-recent business days to include in context.
    covariate_series_ids : list[str] or None
        When provided, the covariate panel is serialized into the prompt
        (the "with-covariates" variant). ``None`` is the target-only variant.
    reasoning_effort : str or None
        Provider reasoning budget. ``None`` (default) uses the provider default;
        the Vector proxy rejects ``'disable'``/``'low'``.
    max_tokens : int, default=16384
        Per-call output token budget. The generous default prevents truncation
        on thinking models where thinking tokens consume the same budget via the
        OpenAI-compatible proxy. The model only generates tokens it needs, so
        non-thinking models are unaffected in cost.
    variant_tag : str or None
        Override the cache tag suffix.
